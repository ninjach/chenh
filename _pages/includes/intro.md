I work at [School of Geographic and Environmental Sciences, Tianjin Normal University](https://csyhj.tjnu.edu.cn/) <img src='./images/logo.png' style='width: 6em;'> as an assistant professor. 

I am now working on Hybrid Modeling of Surface-Earth System. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [ninjalago@yeah.net](mailto:ninjalago@yeah.net).

I finished my postdoctal project from [School of Earth System Science, Tianjin University](http://aircas.ac.cn/) (天津大学地球系统科学学院), advised by [Tiejun Wang (王铁军)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=7dcgS5oAAAAJ).
I graduated from [Aerospace Information research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://aircas.ac.cn/) (中国科学院空天信息创新研究院) with a phd degree, advised by [Wanchang Zhang (张万昌)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xTeUFBgAAAAJ). I also collaborate with [Huiran Gao (高会然)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=88wgC3wAAAAJ/) from [National Institute of Natural Hazards](http://www.ninhm.ac.cn/index.html) <img src='./images/logo_gao.png' style="width: 4em;">, and [Prof. Harry Vereecken](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BXqipW4AAAAJ) from [Institute of Bio- and Geosciences, Agrosphere (IBG-3), Forschungszentrum Jülich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/de/ibg/ibg-3) <img src='./images/Logo.2ceb35fc.svg' style="width: 4em;"> closely. 

My research fields include GIScience, remote sensing, and environmental modeling. More specifically, I am interested in applying various geospatial techniques to study Earth and Planetary Sciences, especially wetland dynamics and hydrology modeling. I have published 30+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rrBhTpMAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRayeRen%2Frayeren.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top SCI journal such as STE, JH, GMD, RS.
