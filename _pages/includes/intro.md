I work at [School of Geographic and Environmental Sciences, Tianjin Normal University](https://csyhj.tjnu.edu.cn/) as an assistant professor. 

I am now working on Hybrid Modeling of Surface-Earth System. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [ninjalago@yeah.net](mailto:ninjalago@yeah.net).

I finished my postdoctal project from [School of Earth System Science, Tianjin University](http://aircas.ac.cn/), advised by [Prof. Tiejun Wang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=7dcgS5oAAAAJ).
I graduated from [Aerospace Information research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://aircas.ac.cn/) with a phd degree, advised by [Prof. Wanchang Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xTeUFBgAAAAJ). I also collaborate with [Dr. Huiran Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=88wgC3wAAAAJ/) from [National Institute of Natural Hazards](http://www.ninhm.ac.cn/index.html), and [Prof. Harry Vereecken](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BXqipW4AAAAJ) from [Institute of Bio- and Geosciences, Agrosphere (IBG-3), Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/de/ibg/ibg-3) closely. 

My research fields include GIScience, remote sensing, and environmental modeling. More specifically, I am interested in applying various geospatial techniques to study Earth and Planetary Sciences, especially wetland dynamics and hydrology modeling. I have published more than 30+ peer-reviewed papers with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rrBhTpMAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>500+</span></strong></a> at the top SCI journal such as STE, JH, GMD, RS.
