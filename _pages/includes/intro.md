I work at [School of Geographic and Environmental Sciences, Tianjin Normal University](https://csyhj.tjnu.edu.cn/) <img src='./images/logo.png' style='width: 6em;'> as an assistant professor. 

I am now working on Hybrid Modeling of Surface-Earth System. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [ninjalago@yeah.net](mailto:ninjalago@yeah.net).

I finished my postdoctal project from [School of Earth System Science, Tianjin University](http://aircas.ac.cn/) (天津大学地球系统科学学院), advised by [Tiejun Wang (王铁军)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=7dcgS5oAAAAJ).
I graduated from [Aerospace Information research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://aircas.ac.cn/) (中国科学院空天信息创新研究院) with a phd degree, advised by [Wanchang Zhang (张万昌)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xTeUFBgAAAAJ). I also collaborate with [Huiran Gao (高会然)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=88wgC3wAAAAJ/) from [National Institute of Natural Hazards](http://www.ninhm.ac.cn/index.html), and [Prof. Harry Vereecken](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BXqipW4AAAAJ) from [Institute of Bio- and Geosciences, Agrosphere (IBG-3), Forschungszentrum Jülich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/de/ibg/ibg-3) <img src='./images/Logo.2ceb35fc.svg' style="width: 4em;"> closely. 

My research fields include GIScience, remote sensing, and environmental modeling. More specifically, I am interested in applying various geospatial techniques to study Earth and Planetary Sciences, especially wetland dynamics and hydrology modeling. I have published more than 30+ peer-reviewed papers with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rrBhTpMAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rrBhTpMAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
